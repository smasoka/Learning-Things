# If during implementing your tests you realize that you want to use a
# fixture function from multiple test files you can move it to a conftest.py file.
# You donâ€™t need to import the fixture you want to use in a test,
# it automatically gets discovered by pytest.
# The discovery of fixture functions starts at test classes,
# then test modules, then conftest.py files and finally builtin
# and third party plugins.

# scope = [function, class, module, package, session]
