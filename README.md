# Learning-Things
Place where I dumb my learning materials 

Once of the reasons I am creating notebooks of my learning materials is I want to learn by (re)coding everything. 
I've made mistakes before where I only look at the code, read the theory but never practice.  
My brain is smart but my fingers are dumb as hell. Something called muscle memeory blah blah blah!
